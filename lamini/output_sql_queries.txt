The SQL query to answer the question "How many singers do we have?" is:  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM singer;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM singer;
SELECT Name, Country, Age  FROM singer  ORDER BY Age DESC;
SELECT Name, Country, Age FROM singer ORDER BY Age DESC;
SELECT AVG(Age) AS Average_Age, MIN(Age) AS Minimum_Age, MAX(Age) AS Maximum_Age  FROM singer  WHERE Country = 'France';
SELECT AVG(singer.Age), MIN(singer.Age), MAX(singer.Age)  FROM singer  WHERE singer.Country = 'France';
My apologies, I made a mistake in the previous query. Here's the corrected query:  SELECT s.Name, s.Song_Release_Year FROM singer s WHERE s.Age = (SELECT MIN(s2.Age) FROM singer s2)
Apologies, I made a mistake in the query. Here is the corrected query:  SELECT song_name, song_release_year FROM singer WHERE age = (SELECT MIN(age) FROM singer);
SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM singer WHERE Age > 20;

It filters the result to only include cars with 4 cylinders (`CD.Cylinders = 4`), orders the result by descending `Horsepower`, and selects only the top 1 row using `LIMIT 1`, which gives us the model with the largest horsepower.
The SQL query to answer the question "For all of the 4 cylinder cars, which model has the most horsepower?" is:  ```sql SELECT T1.Model  FROM car_names AS T1  JOIN cars_data AS T2 ON T1.MakeId = T2.Id  WHERE T2.Cylinders = 4  ORDER BY T2.Horsepower DESC  LIMIT 1; ```
SELECT     car_names.MakeId,     car_names.Make FROM     cars_data JOIN     car_names ON cars_data.Id = car_names.MakeId WHERE     cars_data.Horsepower > (SELECT MIN(Horsepower) FROM cars_data)     AND cars_data.Cylinders <= 3;
Here's the SQL query that answers your question:  ```sql SELECT t2.MakeId, t2.Make FROM cars_data AS t1 JOIN car_names AS t2 ON t1.Id = t2.MakeId WHERE t1.Horsepower > (SELECT MIN(Horsepower) FROM cars_data)   AND t1.Cylinders < 4; ```
SELECT MAX(MPG) FROM cars_data WHERE Cylinders = 8 AND Year < 1980;
SELECT MAX(MPG) FROM cars_data WHERE Cylinders = 8 OR Year < 1980;
Here is the SQL query that answers the question:  ```sql SELECT DISTINCT T1.model FROM model_list AS T1 JOIN car_names AS T2 ON T1.Model = T2.Model JOIN cars_data AS T3 ON T2.MakeId = T3.Id JOIN car_makers AS T4 ON T1.Maker = T4.Id WHERE T3.Weight < 3500 AND T4.FullName != 'Ford Motor Company'; ```
SELECT DISTINCT T1.Model FROM model_list AS T1 JOIN car_names AS T2 ON T1.Model = T2.Model JOIN cars_data AS T3 ON T2.MakeId = T3.Id JOIN car_makers AS T4 ON T2.Make = T4.Maker WHERE T3.Weight < 3500 AND T4.Maker <> 'Ford Motor Company';
``` SELECT CountryName FROM countries WHERE CountryId NOT IN (     SELECT DISTINCT Country     FROM car_makers ); ```
The SQL query that answers the question "What are the names of the countries with no car makers?" is:  ``` SELECT CountryName  FROM countries  WHERE CountryId NOT IN (SELECT Country FROM car_makers) ```
Here is the simplified version of the SQL query:  ```sql SELECT t1.Id, t1.Maker FROM car_makers AS t1 JOIN model_list AS t2 ON t1.Id = t2.Maker JOIN car_names AS t3 ON t2.Model = t3.Model GROUP BY t1.Id, t1.Maker HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT t2.Model) >= 2 AND COUNT(DISTINCT t1.Id) > 3; ```
SELECT car_makers.Id, car_makers.Maker FROM car_makers INNER JOIN model_list ON car_makers.Id = model_list.Maker INNER JOIN car_names ON model_list.Model = car_names.Model GROUP BY car_makers.Id, car_makers.Maker HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT model_list.Model) >= 2 AND COUNT(DISTINCT car_names.MakeId) > 3;
SELECT countries.CountryId, countries.CountryName FROM countries JOIN car_makers ON countries.CountryId = car_makers.Country WHERE countries.CountryId IN (     SELECT countries.CountryId     FROM countries     JOIN car_makers ON countries.CountryId = car_makers.Country     GROUP BY countries.CountryId     HAVING COUNT(car_makers.Id) > 3 ) OR car_makers.Maker = 'fiat';
SELECT CountryId, CountryName FROM countries WHERE CountryId IN (     SELECT car_makers.Country     FROM car_makers     GROUP BY car_makers.Country     HAVING COUNT(*) > 3 ) OR CountryId IN (     SELECT countries.CountryId     FROM countries     JOIN car_makers ON countries.CountryId = car_makers.Country     JOIN model_list ON car_makers.Id = model_list.Maker     JOIN car_names ON model_list.ModelId = car_names.MakeId     WHERE car_names.Model = 'fiat' );

Here is the SQL query:  ```sql SELECT MIN(Version_Number), Template_Type_Code FROM Templates GROUP BY Template_Type_Code ORDER BY MIN(Version_Number) LIMIT 1; ```  This query will return the smallest version number and its corresponding template type code. It groups the templates by template type code, orders them by the smallest version number, and selects the first row using the LIMIT 1 clause.
SELECT MIN(Version_Number) AS Lowest_Version_Number, Template_Type_Code FROM Templates GROUP BY Template_Type_Code;

The SQL query to answer the question "Which language is spoken by the largest number of countries?" is:  ```sql SELECT Language  FROM countrylanguage  GROUP BY Language  ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC  LIMIT 1; ```
Here is the SQL query that answers your question:  ```sql SELECT Language FROM countrylanguage GROUP BY Language ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1; ```
SELECT c.Name AS CountryName, cl.Language AS SpokenLanguage FROM countrylanguage AS cl JOIN (   SELECT CountryCode, MAX(Percentage) AS MaxPercentage   FROM countrylanguage   GROUP BY CountryCode ) AS sub ON cl.CountryCode = sub.CountryCode AND cl.Percentage = sub.MaxPercentage JOIN country AS c ON cl.CountryCode = c.Code;
Actually, the above query is not correct as it only retrieves the language and country code with the maximum percentage for each country. To obtain the languages spoken by the greatest percentage of people for each country, you need to retrieve the language(s) with the maximum percentage for each country.  Here's the correct query:  SELECT cl.CountryCode, cl.Language FROM countrylanguage AS cl JOIN (     SELECT CountryCode, MAX(Percentage) AS max_percentage     FROM countrylanguage     GROUP BY CountryCode ) AS sub ON cl.CountryCode = sub.CountryCode AND cl.Percentage = sub.max_percentage;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM countrylanguage WHERE Language = 'Spanish' AND IsOfficial = 'T';
SELECT CountryCode FROM countrylanguage WHERE Language = "Spanish" GROUP BY CountryCode HAVING Percentage = (SELECT MAX(Percentage) FROM countrylanguage WHERE Language = "Spanish");
SELECT CountryCode FROM countrylanguage WHERE Language = 'Spanish' AND IsOfficial = 'T';

SELECT Record_Company FROM orchestra ORDER BY Year_of_Founded DESC;
SELECT Record_Company FROM orchestra ORDER BY Year_of_Founded DESC;
The SQL query to calculate the average attendance of shows is:  ```sql SELECT AVG(Attendance) FROM show; ```
SELECT AVG(Attendance) FROM show;
Here's the SQL query: ```sql SELECT MAX(Share) AS Maximum_Share, MIN(Share) AS Minimum_Share FROM performance WHERE Type <> 'Live final'; ```
SELECT MAX(Share) AS Maximum_Share, MIN(Share) AS Minimum_Share FROM performance WHERE Type <> 'Live final';
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Nationality) FROM conductor;
Here is the SQL query that counts the number of different nationalities of conductors:  ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Nationality) FROM conductor; ```
SELECT Name FROM conductor ORDER BY Year_of_Work DESC;
Here is the SQL query:  ```sql SELECT Name  FROM conductor  ORDER BY Year_of_Work DESC; ```
Alternative SQL query: SELECT Name FROM conductor WHERE Year_of_Work = (SELECT MAX(Year_of_Work) FROM conductor);
Here is the SQL query:  ```sql SELECT Name FROM conductor ORDER BY Year_of_Work DESC LIMIT 1; ```  This query selects the name from the `conductor` table, orders the records by the `Year_of_Work` column in descending order, and limits the result to only the first record. This will give you the name of the conductor who has worked the greatest number of years.

The SQL query to answer the question "How many high schoolers are there?" is as follows:  ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Highschooler; ```
The SQL query to count the number of high schoolers is:  ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Highschooler; ```
SELECT name, grade FROM Highschooler;
Sure! The SQL query to retrieve the names and grades for each high schooler would be:  ```sql SELECT name, grade FROM Highschooler; ```
SELECT grade FROM Highschooler;
The SQL query to retrieve the grade of each high schooler is:  ```sql SELECT grade FROM Highschooler; ```
SELECT grade FROM Highschooler WHERE name = 'Kyle';
The correct SQL query to return the grade for the high schooler named Kyle is:  ```sql SELECT grade FROM Highschooler WHERE name = 'Kyle'; ```
SELECT name FROM Highschooler WHERE grade = 10;
SELECT name FROM Highschooler WHERE grade = 10;
SELECT ID FROM Highschooler WHERE name = 'Kyle';
SELECT ID FROM Highschooler WHERE name = 'Kyle';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Highschooler WHERE grade IN (9, 10);
